<p>I got frustrated with <a href="http://gawker.sourceforge.net/Gawker.html">Gawker's</a> lack of Multi-Display support. So I did what you do with OpenSource software and added it.</p>
<p>You can find the source that is up to date on <a href="https://github.com/twohlix/">my github</a>.</p>
<p>Warning: Youtube doesnt like super wide videos. heh.
