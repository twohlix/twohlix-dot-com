    that's also using Twilio to take care of people's buzzer problems.  We've got
    an auto-unlock mode similar to yours, but it uses security codes (so not just
    anyone can get in!), multiple phone forwarding, and SMS notifications as well.

<p>I got tired of walking down to the front door to let my friends into my apartment building and I also didn't want people calling my phone from the front door. So I took a cue from <a href="http://jmtame.posterous.com/hacking-your-apartments-electronic-entry-syst">Jared Tame</a> and decided to use <a href="http://www.twilio.com">twilio</a> to automatically buzz people in.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://gist.github.com/1890379">little script</a> later and I'm up and running.</p>
<p>It costs me $1/mo + 1cent per unlock and about an hour of fiddling around with everything. Twilio even started me off with $30 free so I added $30 more to my account once and now I can be up and running for ~4 years (assuming 300 unlocks over 4 years) for a total of $30 + hour of my life.</p>
<p>giggity. This project also made me want to start playing with twilio. Video to come later.</p>
