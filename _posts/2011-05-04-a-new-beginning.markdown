Finally I've moved onto rehosting twohlix.com (and all my domains) on my fresh new VPS.
The past couple of days since purchasing my VPS has been setting up my environment. Hell I'm even hosting <a href="http://spectaculartasks.com">my buddy's site</a> on here. He's still learning css and whatnot.
<p>I'm sure i'll have some growing pains as I host more and more sites on here (maybe <a href="http://twoguysrally.com">Two Guys Rally</a> or even <a href="http://marshsmith.com">Marshsmith</a>). </p>
<p>MORE LATER</p>
