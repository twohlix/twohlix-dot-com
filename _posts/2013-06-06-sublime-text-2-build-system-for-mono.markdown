<p>So I was struggling to find a good build system for mono. After much struggling with regexes I finally got the file_regex down so it'll take you the right line and column.</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute to it every gist is also a pushable repo. </p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/twohlix/5719270.js"></script>
Clone that gist or copy paste it into a build system of your own. You might have to remove the .json file extension, that's in there to get github to do syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>If you don't have javascript enabled you cannot see the gist above. Check it out on <a href="https://gist.github.com/twohlix/5719270">my github</a>. </p>
